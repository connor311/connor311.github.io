Over the past couple of weeks I have come to realize that I work with a number of people that I would love to start a company with.  This thought brought me to create [Link Corp](http://linkcorp.nyc).

Link Corp is a private club of sorts, comprised of only people I would want to work with.  The name came about after I scribbled an interesting design on my green engineering pad, that in my mind resembled the design on Link's shield from Zelda.

Everyone seems to see different things in the logo, which is why I think it is really quite awesome!

Alright, so I had a logo and a group of people now what??  Create business cards... and STICKERS!!!!  and a Website.

If you want to check it out go to: [http://LinkCorp.nyc](http://linkcorp.nyc).  This also happens to be the first NYC domain I have every purchased so that was pretty fun!  Turns out you just have to have a NYC address.

I do not know what I will do with these amazing group of friends, but I can only imagine it will be awesome!  I have a subscription form on the Link Corp website if you are interested in keeping informed of any software we put out.
